## Secret Chronicles Classic Platformer
A [libgdx](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx) example project.

Massively bugfixed and extended version of pedja's Secret Maryo Chronicles Clone.
(In other words: This is a fork of a [clone](https://github.com/pedja1/SMC-Android)
of a [clone](https://github.com/FluXy/SMC).)

Although this is a great project and example for a full libGDX game, he has unfortunately given 
up on the project for some reason without finishing it. So I've taken over some work:

* All level bugs fixed until level 13 Eatomania
* Game controller support (using [gdx-controllerutils](https://github.com/MrStahlfelge/gdx-controllerutils))
* Works on GWT/HTML5 backend
* Resizable
* Game service support (using [gdx-gamesvcs](https://github.com/MrStahlfelge/gdx-gamesvcs))
* [FireTV support](https://medium.com/@bschulte19e/releasing-a-game-for-amazon-firetv-23dcb68145da), works with TV remote only

Please excuse German commit messages, I did not plan to make this public in the first place.

Please note: This is not a clean demonstration project, but a grown learning project. Not everything 
is done in a perfect way.
